Abstract

The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) writing assistants has fundamentally transformed academic writing practices, yet their impact on writing quality remains contested. This systematic review synthesizes empirical evidence on how AI writing tools affect academic writing quality across educational contexts. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched five academic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore) for peer-reviewed studies published between 2018-2024, yielding 47 eligible studies after screening 892 initial records. Studies were assessed for methodological quality and synthesized using thematic analysis. Results indicate that AI writing assistants significantly improve mechanical aspects of writing, including grammar accuracy (d = 0.78), vocabulary diversity (d = 0.62), and structural coherence (d = 0.54). However, effects on higher-order writing skills showed mixed outcomes, with modest improvements in argumentation quality (d = 0.31) but concerns regarding originality and critical thinking. Notably, effectiveness varied by user proficiency level, with non-native speakers showing greater gains. While AI tools enhance surface-level writing quality, their impact on deep learning and authentic academic voice warrants careful consideration. These findings suggest the need for pedagogical frameworks that leverage AI benefits while preserving essential academic writing competencies.
