# Systematic Review Checklist (PRISMA 2020)

## Planning Phase
- [ ] Formulate clear research question (PICO/PICOS)
- [ ] Register protocol (PROSPERO)
- [ ] Define eligibility criteria
- [ ] Identify databases to search
- [ ] Develop search strategy
- [ ] Plan data extraction form
- [ ] Define quality assessment tools
- [ ] Plan statistical analyses

## Search Strategy
### Databases
- [ ] PubMed/MEDLINE
- [ ] Embase
- [ ] Cochrane Library

- [ ] Scopus
- [ ] Google Scholar
- [ ] Clinical trial registries
- [ ] Grey literature sources

### Search Terms Development
- [ ] Identify key concepts
- [ ] Find synonyms and related terms
- [ ] Use MeSH/Emtree terms
- [ ] Apply Boolean operators
- [ ] Test and refine search

## Study Selection
- [ ] Export search results
- [ ] Remove duplicates
- [ ] Title/abstract screening
