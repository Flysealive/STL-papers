   - No real-time prediction systems

3. **Integrated Navigation Systems**
   - Current systems operate in isolation
   - No combined catheter selection + navigation models
   - Limited real-world validation

### Secondary Gaps:

4. **Multi-center Validation Studies**
   - 75% of studies single-center
   - Limited generalizability assessment

5. **Interpretability and Explainability**
   - Most models are "black boxes"
   - Clinical adoption barriers

6. **Real-time Implementation**
   - Few studies address computational constraints
   - Integration with cath lab systems limited

## Conclusion

The field of AI/ML in interventional cardiology shows rapid advancement in image analysis and 3D reconstruction, but significant gaps exist in predictive modeling for procedural decisions. The complete absence of ML models for catheter exchange prediction represents a critical unmet need and promising research opportunity. Future work should focus on developing clinically integrated, interpretable models that address real-world procedural challenges.
