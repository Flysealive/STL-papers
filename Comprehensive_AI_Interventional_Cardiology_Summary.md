The literature reveals significant advances in 3D vessel modeling and point cloud analysis, but critical gaps exist in catheter selection algorithms and exchange prediction. The complete absence of ML models for catheter exchange necessity represents the most significant opportunity for impactful research. With catheter exchange affecting 5-15% of procedures, developing predictive models could substantially improve procedural efficiency and patient outcomes.
