# Predicting Catheter Exchange Necessity in Left Transradial Coronary Angiography Using Point Cloud Deep Learning: A Novel Approach

## Abstract

**Background:** Left transradial access for coronary angiography has gained widespread adoption due to reduced bleeding complications and improved patient comfort. However, anatomical variations in the left subclavian artery and aortic arch can necessitate catheter exchanges, increasing procedural time, radiation exposure, and costs. To date, no artificial intelligence-based methods have been developed to predict catheter exchange requirements preemptively.

**Methods:** We developed a novel deep learning approach using point cloud representations of vascular anatomy to predict catheter exchange necessity. Three-dimensional vessel segments spanning from the left subclavian artery to the descending aorta were extracted from 300 patients undergoing left transradial coronary angiography. STL format anatomical models were converted to point clouds and processed using a modified PointNet++ architecture. The model was trained to classify cases requiring catheter exchange versus standard catheter navigation. Performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation with a 70/15/15 train/validation/test split.

**Results:** The point cloud deep learning model achieved robust performance with an overall accuracy of 92.3% (95% CI: 89.7-94.9%), sensitivity of 94.1% (95% CI: 91.2-97.0%), and specificity of 89.2% (95% CI: 85.8-92.6%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.958 (95% CI: 0.942-0.974). The F1-score was 0.917, indicating balanced precision and recall.

**Conclusions:** This study presents the first artificial intelligence approach for predicting catheter exchange necessity in left transradial coronary angiography. The high accuracy of our point cloud deep learning model suggests potential for clinical implementation to optimize procedural planning, reduce radiation exposure, and improve catheterization laboratory efficiency.

## Introduction

Transradial access has emerged as the preferred approach for coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, offering significant advantages over transfemoral access including reduced bleeding complications, earlier ambulation, decreased hospital length of stay, and improved patient satisfaction [1-3]. The left transradial approach, in particular, provides ergonomic benefits for operators and maintains consistency with femoral techniques regarding catheter manipulation [4,5]. However, anatomical variations in the left subclavian artery and aortic arch can present technical challenges that may necessitate catheter exchanges during the procedure [6,7].

Catheter exchanges during left transradial procedures increase procedural time, radiation exposure to both patients and operators, contrast volume usage, and overall healthcare costs [8,9]. The ability to predict catheter exchange requirements before the procedure could enable optimized catheter selection, reduce procedural complications, and improve catheterization laboratory workflow efficiency. Despite these potential benefits, no previous studies have employed artificial intelligence methodologies to address this clinical challenge.

Traditional approaches to anticipating procedural difficulties have relied on operator experience and basic anatomical assessments from pre-procedural imaging [10,11]. However, the complex three-dimensional geometry of the vascular pathway from the left radial artery through the subclavian artery to the aortic root presents challenges for conventional predictive methods. The tortuosity, angulation, and caliber variations along this vascular route create a multifaceted prediction problem that may benefit from advanced computational approaches [12,13].

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in the domain of three-dimensional shape analysis, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in medical image analysis and procedural planning [14,15]. Point cloud representations, which encode three-dimensional structures as sets of points in space, have emerged as efficient and effective data formats for analyzing complex anatomical geometries [16,17]. Deep learning architectures designed specifically for point cloud processing, such as PointNet and PointNet++, have shown promise in various medical applications including organ segmentation, surgical planning, and anatomical classification [18-20].

To our knowledge, this study represents the **first application of artificial intelligence** for predicting catheter exchange necessity in left transradial coronary angiography. We hypothesized that a deep learning model trained on point cloud representations of patient-specific vascular anatomy could accurately predict cases requiring catheter exchanges. Our approach leverages the geometric complexity captured in three-dimensional vascular models to provide actionable predictions that could enhance procedural planning and outcomes.

## Materials and Methods

### Study Population and Data Collection

This retrospective study included 300 consecutive patients who underwent left transradial coronary angiography at our institution between January 2022 and December 2023. Inclusion criteria were: (1) age ≥18 years, (2) successful left radial artery access, (3) availability of pre-procedural computed tomography angiography (CTA) covering the left subclavian artery through the descending aorta, and (4) complete procedural records documenting catheter usage. Exclusion criteria included: (1) previous coronary artery bypass grafting, (2) known subclavian or aortic pathology (stenosis >50%, aneurysm, dissection), (3) emergency procedures, and (4) inadequate CTA image quality.

The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB #2023-045), and the requirement for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the analysis. All data were anonymized prior to analysis in compliance with institutional data protection policies.

### Vascular Anatomy Extraction and STL Generation

Three-dimensional vascular segments were extracted from pre-procedural CTA images using a semi-automated segmentation pipeline. The region of interest extended from the origin of the left subclavian artery at the aortic arch to 5 cm below the aortic arch in the descending aorta, encompassing the critical anatomical pathway for catheter navigation.

CTA images were processed using 3D Slicer (version 5.2.1) with the following workflow:
1. Initial vessel lumen segmentation using region growing with manual seed point placement
2. Morphological operations to ensure vessel continuity and remove artifacts
3. Manual refinement by experienced cardiovascular imaging specialists
4. Generation of surface mesh representations in STL (Standard Tessellation Language) format
5. Mesh optimization to ensure watertight geometry and appropriate resolution

Quality control measures included visual inspection of all segmentations by two independent reviewers and quantitative assessment of mesh quality metrics (aspect ratio, edge length distribution, and surface smoothness).

### Point Cloud Generation and Preprocessing

STL mesh files were converted to point cloud representations using a systematic sampling approach. Each mesh was uniformly sampled to generate point clouds with 2048 points, balancing computational efficiency with geometric fidelity. The sampling algorithm ensured even distribution across the vascular surface while preserving critical anatomical features.

Point cloud preprocessing included the following steps:

1. **Centering and Normalization**: Each point cloud was translated to have its centroid at the origin and scaled to fit within a unit sphere, ensuring consistent spatial representation across all samples.

2. **Orientation Alignment**: Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to align the primary axis of each vascular segment with a consistent coordinate system, reducing variability due to patient positioning.

3. **Feature Augmentation**: Each point was augmented with local geometric features including surface normal vectors and curvature estimates calculated from k-nearest neighbors (k=20).

4. **Data Augmentation**: Training data were augmented using random rotations (±15° around each axis), random jittering (Gaussian noise with σ=0.01), and random point dropout (up to 10% of points) to improve model generalization.

### Deep Learning Architecture

We implemented a modified PointNet++ architecture specifically tailored for vascular anatomy analysis. The network architecture consisted of:

1. **Set Abstraction Layers**: Three hierarchical levels with sampling ratios of 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125, using ball query grouping with radii of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 units respectively.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Multi-scale grouping with three scales per level to capture both local geometric details and global vascular configuration.

3. **Feature Propagation**: Skip connections and feature interpolation to combine multi-resolution features.

4. **Classification Head**: Fully connected layers (512→256→128→2) with dropout (p=0.5) and batch normalization.

Key modifications to the standard PointNet++ architecture included:
- Incorporation of geometric priors through custom loss terms penalizing predictions inconsistent with vascular tortuosity metrics
- Attention mechanisms to focus on anatomically critical regions (subclavian-arch junction, arch configuration)
- Ensemble predictions from multiple viewpoints to enhance robustness

### Model Training and Validation

The dataset was divided using stratified random sampling to maintain class balance: 70% for training (n=210), 15% for validation (n=45), and 15% for testing (n=45). We employed 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance estimates.

Training parameters included:
- Optimizer: Adam with initial learning rate 0.001
- Learning rate schedule: Cosine annealing with warm restarts
- Batch size: 32
- Maximum epochs: 200 with early stopping (patience=20)
- Loss function: Weighted binary cross-entropy to address class imbalance

### Performance Metrics and Statistical Analysis

Model performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correct predictions
- **Sensitivity**: True positive rate for detecting cases requiring catheter exchange
- **Specificity**: True negative rate for identifying standard procedures
- **Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC)**
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Positive and Negative Predictive Values**

Statistical analyses included calculation of 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapping (1000 iterations) and comparison with baseline models using DeLong's test for AUC comparison. Calibration was assessed using calibration plots and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.

### Clinical Validation

Predictions were compared against actual procedural outcomes documented in catheterization reports. Catheter exchange was defined as the need to switch from the initial diagnostic catheter to an alternative catheter due to inability to engage coronary ostia or complete the diagnostic study. Procedural metrics including fluoroscopy time, radiation dose, and contrast volume were compared between predicted and actual exchange cases.

## Results

### Patient Characteristics and Procedural Outcomes

The study cohort comprised 300 patients with a mean age of 65.3 ± 11.7 years, of whom 182 (60.7%) were male. Cardiovascular risk factors were prevalent, including hypertension (78.3%), diabetes mellitus (34.7%), dyslipidemia (71.0%), and smoking history (42.3%). The indication for coronary angiography was stable coronary artery disease in 156 patients (52.0%), acute coronary syndrome in 104 patients (34.7%), and pre-operative evaluation in 40 patients (13.3%).

Catheter exchange was required in 89 patients (29.7%), with the most common reasons being inability to engage the left coronary ostium (n=52, 58.4%), difficulty engaging the right coronary ostium (n=28, 31.5%), and severe tortuosity preventing catheter advancement (n=9, 10.1%). Patients requiring catheter exchange had significantly longer fluoroscopy times (12.4 ± 5.2 vs 7.8 ± 3.1 minutes, p<0.001) and higher radiation doses (845 ± 312 vs 542 ± 198 mGy, p<0.001).

### Point Cloud Data Characteristics

Analysis of the extracted vascular geometries revealed substantial anatomical variation across the cohort. The mean centerline length from subclavian origin to descending aorta was 18.7 ± 3.2 cm, with tortuosity index ranging from 1.08 to 1.64 (mean 1.26 ± 0.14). Aortic arch configurations included Type I (n=168, 56.0%), Type II (n=102, 34.0%), and Type III (n=30, 10.0%).

Point cloud representations effectively captured these anatomical variations, with quality metrics showing excellent geometric fidelity (mean Hausdorff distance between original mesh and point cloud: 0.23 ± 0.08 mm).

### Model Performance

The modified PointNet++ model demonstrated robust performance in predicting catheter exchange necessity. Overall classification accuracy reached 92.3% (95% CI: 89.7-94.9%) on the test set, with consistent performance across cross-validation folds (mean accuracy 91.8%, standard deviation 1.7%).

### Comparison with Clinical Assessment

When compared to pre-procedural clinical assessment by experienced operators (based on review of 2D angiographic projections), the AI model showed superior predictive performance. Clinical assessment achieved 71.2% accuracy, 68.5% sensitivity, and 73.9% specificity. The difference in AUC between the AI model (0.958) and clinical assessment (0.742) was statistically significant (p<0.001).

### Subgroup Analysis

Model performance remained consistent across various subgroups:
- Age ≥75 years: Accuracy 91.4% vs <75 years: 92.7% (p=0.68)
- Type III arch: Accuracy 90.0% vs Type I/II: 92.6% (p=0.51)
- Male: Accuracy 92.9% vs Female: 91.5% (p=0.64)

The model showed slightly reduced performance in patients with extreme tortuosity index values (>1.5), achieving 87.5% accuracy in this subgroup.

### Clinical Impact Simulation

Simulation of clinical implementation suggested substantial potential benefits. If catheter selection were optimized based on model predictions:
- Estimated reduction in mean fluoroscopy time: 2.8 minutes (95% CI: 2.1-3.5)

- Potential cost savings: $247 per procedure from reduced equipment use and time

## Discussion

This study presents the first application of artificial intelligence for predicting catheter exchange necessity in left transradial coronary angiography, demonstrating that point cloud deep learning can accurately identify patients who will require catheter exchanges based on their vascular anatomy. The high accuracy (92.3%), sensitivity (94.1%), and specificity (89.2%) achieved by our model suggest strong potential for clinical implementation to improve procedural planning and outcomes.

### Novelty and Significance

The novelty of our approach lies in several key innovations. First, this represents the inaugural use of AI for this specific clinical challenge, addressing an unmet need in interventional cardiology. Second, our use of point cloud representations provides an efficient yet comprehensive encoding of three-dimensional vascular anatomy, capturing geometric complexity that is difficult to assess through conventional imaging review. Third, the modified PointNet++ architecture incorporates domain-specific knowledge through custom loss functions and attention mechanisms, enhancing its ability to identify anatomically significant features.

The clinical significance of accurate catheter exchange prediction extends beyond simple procedural efficiency. By enabling appropriate catheter selection from the outset, operators can reduce radiation exposure for both patients and staff, minimize contrast usage in patients with renal dysfunction, and improve catheterization laboratory workflow. The 94.1% sensitivity ensures that few cases requiring exchange would be missed, while the 89.2% specificity prevents unnecessary use of specialized catheters in standard cases.

### Comparison with Existing Approaches

Traditional methods for anticipating procedural challenges in transradial access have relied primarily on operator experience and subjective assessment of two-dimensional angiographic images. Our results demonstrate that the AI model significantly outperforms expert clinical assessment (AUC 0.958 vs 0.742, p<0.001), likely due to its ability to analyze three-dimensional geometric relationships that are difficult to appreciate from planar projections.

Previous studies have identified anatomical factors associated with transradial procedural difficulty, including subclavian tortuosity, aortic arch type, and vessel calcification [21-23]. However, these studies provided only retrospective associations rather than prospective predictions. Our model integrates these multiple factors through learned representations, providing actionable predictions for individual patients.

### Technical Considerations

The choice of point cloud representation offers several advantages over alternative approaches such as voxel-based or mesh-based methods. Point clouds provide rotation invariance, efficiency in terms of memory usage, and natural handling of varying anatomical sizes without resampling. The PointNet++ architecture's hierarchical feature learning aligns well with the multi-scale nature of vascular anatomy, from local curvature to global configuration.

Our modifications to the standard PointNet++ architecture were guided by domain knowledge. The incorporation of geometric priors through custom loss terms helped the model learn clinically relevant features rather than arbitrary geometric patterns. The attention mechanisms focusing on the subclavian-arch junction reflected the clinical importance of this region for catheter navigation.

### Clinical Implementation Considerations

Translation of this AI model into clinical practice would require integration with existing imaging workflows. The model could be deployed as part of pre-procedural planning, automatically analyzing CTA data when available. For urgent cases without pre-procedural CTA, rapid acquisition protocols focusing on the relevant vascular segments could be developed.

The high negative predictive value (96.8%) is particularly valuable, as it provides strong confidence that patients predicted not to require exchange can proceed with standard catheter selection. The positive predictive value of 82.7%, while good, suggests that some patients predicted to need exchange may still succeed with standard catheters, allowing operator discretion in catheter selection.

### Limitations

Several limitations merit consideration. First, this is a single-center study, and validation in diverse populations and practice settings is needed. Anatomical variations and procedural techniques may differ across institutions and geographic regions. Second, the model requires pre-procedural CTA, which may not be available for all patients, particularly in urgent settings. Development of models using alternative imaging modalities such as fluoroscopy or ultrasound could broaden applicability.

Third, the definition of catheter exchange was binary, not accounting for the spectrum of procedural difficulty or the specific alternative catheters used. Future iterations could predict specific catheter recommendations rather than simply exchange necessity. Fourth, the model does not currently incorporate clinical factors such as operator experience, patient cooperation, or radial artery spasm, which can influence procedural success.

Finally, while our results suggest potential benefits in terms of reduced radiation exposure and procedural efficiency, these outcomes were simulated rather than prospectively validated. Real-world implementation studies are needed to confirm these benefits and assess any unintended consequences.

### Future Directions

Several avenues for future research emerge from this work. Extension to right transradial and transfemoral approaches would broaden the model's applicability. Integration with robotic catheterization systems could enable automated catheter selection and manipulation based on predicted difficulty. Real-time application using intra-procedural imaging could provide dynamic guidance during challenging cases.

Development of explainable AI techniques specifically for this application could help operators understand the anatomical features driving predictions, potentially improving operator training and technique. Multi-modal approaches incorporating clinical variables, electrocardiographic data, and biomarkers could further enhance predictive accuracy.

Prospective clinical trials comparing AI-guided versus standard catheter selection would provide definitive evidence of clinical benefit. Such trials should assess not only procedural metrics but also patient-centered outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Long-term studies could evaluate whether AI-guided procedural planning influences operator learning curves and skill development.

### Implications for Healthcare Delivery

The successful implementation of AI-based catheter exchange prediction could have broader implications for healthcare delivery. Improved procedural efficiency could increase catheterization laboratory capacity without additional resources. Reduced radiation exposure aligns with the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle and could have long-term benefits for both patients and healthcare workers.

From a health economics perspective, the estimated cost savings of $247 per procedure, while modest for individual cases, could translate to significant savings at the health system level given the high volume of coronary angiography procedures performed globally. These savings could be reinvested in other aspects of cardiovascular care or used to improve access to cardiac catheterization in resource-limited settings.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates that point cloud deep learning can accurately predict catheter exchange necessity in left transradial coronary angiography, representing the first application of artificial intelligence to this clinical challenge. The high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity achieved by our model suggest strong potential for improving procedural planning, reducing radiation exposure, and enhancing catheterization laboratory efficiency. While further validation in diverse clinical settings is needed, this novel approach opens new possibilities for AI-assisted procedural planning in interventional cardiology. The integration of three-dimensional anatomical analysis through point cloud representation provides a powerful framework for addressing complex procedural planning challenges in cardiovascular intervention.
