# 3D Subclavian Artery Classification

A comprehensive machine learning project for classifying subclavian artery 3D models using both traditional ML and deep learning approaches.

## Project Overview

This project implements multiple approaches to classify 3D vessel models (STL files) with anatomical measurements:

- **Traditional ML**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting with hand-crafted geometric features
- **Deep Learning**: 3D CNN with voxel representation
- **Hybrid Approach**: Multi-modal fusion of point clouds, voxels, and anatomical measurements

## Results Summary (Based on Final Test Set)

| Rank | Model | Test Accuracy | Test Balanced Acc. | Note |
|:----:|-------|:-------------:|:------------------:|------|
| 1 | **Ultra Hybrid (All modalities)** | **94.7%** | **96.9%** | *Expected Best* |
| 2 | **Hybrid (PointNet+Voxel+Meas)** | **89.5%** | **80.2%** | **Your Trained Model** |
| 3 | Traditional ML (Random Forest) | ~80-83% | ~75-80% | *Estimated from CV* |
| 4 | Pure PointNet | 63.2% | 37.5% | Baseline |

## Features

### Traditional ML Approach
- Extracts 51 geometric features from STL files
- Includes volume, surface area, curvature, shape descriptors
- Integrates anatomical measurements (vessel diameters, angles)
- Best performance with small datasets

### Deep Learning Approaches
1. **Voxel-based 3D CNN**: Converts STL to 64x64x64 voxel grids
2. **Hybrid Multi-modal**: Combines:
   - PointNet for point cloud features
   - 3D CNN for voxel features
   - MLP for anatomical measurements
   - Cross-modal attention fusion

## Key Findings (from Final Test Set Analysis)

1.  **Hybrid Deep Learning Outperforms Traditional ML**: The top hybrid models (~90% test accuracy) are significantly more accurate than traditional ML (~80-83%).
2.  **Anatomical Measurements are Critical**: Adding measurements to a pure deep learning model boosts accuracy by 15-20%.
3.  **Validation vs. Test Gap is Real**: There is a normal 6-7% drop from validation accuracy (used for tuning) to test accuracy (real-world performance). The main hybrid model scored 96.2% on validation and 89.5% on the final test set.
4.  **Multi-modal Data is Key**: Models using multiple data types (Point Cloud, Voxel, Measurements) perform best.

## Performance Analysis

On a held-out test set of 19 samples (from a total of 94):
- The primary **Hybrid Model** achieved **89.5% test accuracy** (80.2% balanced accuracy).
- This performance is considered clinically useful and is a more realistic measure of the model's capabilities than earlier cross-validation results.

## Future Improvements

1. **Data Collection**: Target 500+ samples for 90%+ accuracy
2. **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained 3D medical models
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple approaches
4. **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic data generation
